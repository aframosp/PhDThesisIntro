# Repository for the introduction of the PhD Thesis "Diagnosing the ISM of galaxies and energetic processes in a cosmological context"

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/aframosp/PhDThesisIntro/HEAD)

This repository contains data and code for the figures (and one table) presented in the introduction of the PhD Thesis ["Diagnosing the ISM of galaxies and energetic processes in a cosmological context"](https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/diagnosing-the-ism-of-galaxies-and-energetic-processes-in-a-cosmo). Each figure has its respective [Jupyter notebooks](/Notebooks). 

## Software requirements

The most important software packages to work with the files in this repository are in [environment.yml](environment.yml). This file is also used to launch a [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) to open the Jupyter notebooks interactively. We print all the packages in a given notebook using the IPython magic extension [watermark](https://github.com/rasbt/watermark). We also use [autotpep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/) to format the code to the PEP 8 style guide. 

## Content

* [Data](/Data): Most of the data related with the figures in the introduction.
* [Figures](/Figures): Figures presented in the introduction.
* [Notebooks](/Notebooks): Most of the code to generate figures (includes the extensions .ipynb and .html)
